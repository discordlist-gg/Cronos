# About the search system.

The search system's core is based off of my work with LNX, unfortunately LNX v0.10
isn't ready yet, so we can't use it with Dlist and all the perks it provides.

If you plan on working in this section I would highly recommend that you learn
Tantivy well beforehand as we use alot of slightly cryptic logic within it.
